# IOT-Android-Things-Project-Backend
iot/spring project for UltraSonic Sensor Andoid Things Project

The middleware between application and Firebase that will be deployed to your Application Server. This project contains the logic that monitors when a new motion log is added on the server. It constructs a push notification to send to registered mobile devices. Also stores the image.
 
The Spring Boot project requires Maven and Redis, which you can install by following the instructions on https://redis.io/topics/quickstart Installing Redis also installs Maven.

Once you have Maven and Redis installed, configure your Backend by changing Authorization key which taken from Firebase and than simply deploy the any server / container.  

You must configure properties which are the following lines.
```
spring.redis.host=yourRemoteHost
spring.redis.password=yourPasswordIfExist
spring.redis.port=yourRemotePort
spring.redis.database=yourDBIndex
image.url.prefix=yourImageServerAddress
notification.title=New notification from Device
```

You should then be able to send notification in your backend whenever you're ready. Default environments & configurations set up for Glassfish Server.

- There is a postman collection for make it easy : )
